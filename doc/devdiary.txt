Tuesday, October 23rd, 2012:
- finally got OpenCV working, having every correct version for each software helps
(Processing 1.5-1, OpenCV 2.3.1, javacvPro 0.5, GSVideo 1.0)
- Blob detection working, simple method (absdiff with ref image and threshold)
- Flowing Bezier Wall working, as well as interaction with said blobs
(position points of curve avoid arriving blobs centroids)
